# 3D Rasterizer

This project is a 3D software rasterizer in C++. Followed the amazing series on rasterizers by [thebennybox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_vvC2G7vRo&list=PLEETnX-uPtBUbVOok816vTl1K9vV1GgH5).

Then further improved by adding support for custom shaders (vertex and fragment shaders), barycentric coordinates, cubemaps and much more. Currently has a smooth shader (with and without texture), flat shader (with and without texture), normal visualization. Plan on improving support for the shaders in the future to make them as flexible as the OpenGL shaders.
